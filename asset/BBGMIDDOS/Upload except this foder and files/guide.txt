Requirements- 

1- Your bot API Token     (you can get it from @BotFather in Telegram)
2- Admin ID of Telegram   (search @userinfobot in telegram, the bot will tell you your ID)

You will be adding these 2 codes inside config.json (paste it carefully),add User ID in users.txt also, and modify the dates if needed.





1. Create a new private Repo in @github.
2. Upload all the files present here.
3. Open 'codespace' section in github and create a new codespace.and wait until entire loading is done.
4. Inside the codespace(web VS code) launch a terminal and run the commands below>>


But if you are running the script locally, you need to go to the folder using Terminal like this- (my ddos files are inside "BGMIDDOS" FOLDER), to go to the folder, copy the path of the folder and paste in terminal- cd 'your ddos path', then do rest other things >>>

PS C:\Users\jrram\OneDrive\Pictures\Documents\GitHub\ESRAT> cd C:\Users\jrram\OneDrive\Pictures\Documents\GitHub\ESRAT\asset\BBGMIDDOS
PS C:\Users\jrram\OneDrive\Pictures\Documents\GitHub\ESRAT\asset\BBGMIDDOS> python3 sahil.py  


5. Commands are.


chmod +x *

./install.sh


Now after that you should get a rebuild popup in the bottom of the screen. Click on "Rebuild", not on full `rebuild.
then after entire loading perform the commands below in terminal, install "pip install flask" if needed (not recommended).
Those 4 commands are enough.


pip install telebot


chmod +x *

python3 sahil.py

and you you should get a message like- "This File Is Made By @SahilModzOwner" and you are good to go.

but things are not done yet, the codespace will run only for 30 minutes in github. To make it run 24/7 you have to go to >settings>codespace>scroll down> select the repository of your ddos file uploaded in github, and change the time to 240 minutes. and click save. Now go to your telegram bot type /start and you should get a Reply, if reply comes that means you are all set now to launch a ddos attack on your target. Happy Hacking. Regards- @jrram3000




yes, sahil.py.enc is encrypted with XOR and Base64 encryption. But i have already decrypted is a python script and it is inside decrypted.sahyil.py.enc.txt text file. Relax it is non of our use now, may be in case for future use.

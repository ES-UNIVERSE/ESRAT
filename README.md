## Overview

**ESRAT** is a modular, cross-platform Remote Administration Toolkit designed to assist **security professionals**, **red teams**, and **penetration testers** in simulating advanced threat scenarios under controlled, legal environments.

Built with stealth, resilience, and usability in mind, ESRAT enables authorized operators to assess endpoint security, test detection capabilities, and validate incident response protocols.

## 🔑 Core Capabilities

- **Real-Time Monitoring** 📲  
  Live screen capture, keystroke logging (for authorized sessions), webcam access, VNC-style remote control, and credential harvesting (in lab environments).
  
- **Remote Command Execution** 🛜  
  Execute shell commands or scripts with elevated privileges on compromised endpoints.

- **Secure Data Exfiltration** 📊  
  Encrypted file transfer from target systems for forensic analysis during authorized engagements.

- **Evasion & Persistence** 🕵️‍♂️  
  Designed to bypass common AV/EDR solutions in testing scenarios. Includes anti-termination mechanisms to maintain session integrity during assessments.

- **Remote Management** ❌  
  Admin-controlled uninstallation—ensuring clean removal post-engagement without requiring physical access.

- **Multi-Platform Support** 🤖  
  Compatible with **Windows**, **Android**, and **iOS** (jailbroken/test devices only).

- **Modular Payloads** 🚨  
  Generate custom payloads tailored to specific engagement requirements (e.g., bind/reverse shells, staged loaders).

- **End-to-End Encryption** 🔐  
  All C2 communications are encrypted using modern cryptographic protocols.

- **Intuitive Web-Based GUI** 📱  
  Clean, responsive admin panel for real-time interaction and session management.
